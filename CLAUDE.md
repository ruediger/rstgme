We want to write a little 2D game. It should be a game with a top down view. The levels are tile based grid. Characters are humans or robots moving in the levels.

Eventually this should be an online game. But for now let's just focus on the player controlling one character and everything else being simple bots.

We are using Rust. Use modern Rust and add well known dependencies. Write tests as you go along. Ask me if you are unsure about things.

You can use Gemini-CLI to run nanobanana to generate graphics or generate them yourself. Submit to git at meaningful intervals.

Use `cargo fmt` to keep code formatted and `cargo clippy` to lint the code.
